### deltaBillingFramework


OSSRTDS
      
      The DSMSAPL program introduced a robust and dependable system for integrating billing and store management. This was much-appreciated, but as all great things must be made greater, on March 14, 2020, delta officially dropped support for the DSMSAPL program.

A big force behind the dropping of support and development of DSMSAPL was the annoucement of the deltaBillingFramework.
The deltaBillingFramework builds upon the stable and robust base that DSMSAPL left. The integraTion of SQLalchemy along with more modifications, towards the creation of a generalized framework system. What we have in plan for the deltaBillingFramework is to make a kind of one-suits-all solution. Ranging from physical stores, to online ones, libraries, and even DIY-hobbyists who'd like to pull off parts of code from here (UNDER LICENSE, ALWAYS). This wide-audience cattering feature of the deltaBillingFramework is what makes it truly worthy of the title "framework".
DSMSAPL shall still be supported slightly, and bug and security patches shall be provided, till the deltaBillingFramework becomes complete, and able to completely replace DSMSAPL.
This changelog-registry will be regularly updates as changes are made. This updation in completely manual.
