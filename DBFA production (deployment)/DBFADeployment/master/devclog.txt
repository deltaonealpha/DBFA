deltaDBFA Infinity Development Changelog | author: @deltaonealpha
- Changelog for DBFA consisting of all changes since DBFA 7
--------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
- User accounts (admin, cashier et cetera)
- Package DBFA with dummy dbs from now, DBFA will detect
  missing files and autogenerate dummy files (basically 
  restore them from a built-in dummy backup yey nice ideaahh)
--------------------------------------------------------------

> Presenting DBFA Restoration (Backup & Switch v2.0)
  Now the 'Backup & Switch' option gives you an option to restore the backup too!
  On selecting 'restore', DBFA will open a file dialog where you can chose the backup .zip file.
  DBFA will automatically scan the backup file's metadata and figure out the earlier installation's password, which
  would be required to complete restoration.

  Upon recieving a valid password, DBFA will restore the backed-up data smoothly and restart DBFA client.


23-10-2020 08:59 Critical Security Patch
> All keys moved from settings > settings >>> to >>> settings > passkeyhandler for organizational purposes.
> Modified most scripts to incorporate password detection from database, removed direct references from the code.
RE > All file references (paths) have been changed to automatically detect the installation directory.

22-10-2020 FULL
> Introducing DBFA Deployment. This is an .exe installer with smarts.
  It will check your registry for a Python installation and will install Python if not found. 
  Then it will pip install all dependencies automatically, and then install DBFA (.py and others)
  This replaces the experimental 'DBFA Executable' releases which used .exe files converted from .py 
  as they were buggy and large in size.

> Updates to Updater (coming soon)
  Starting soon, DBFA's Deployment Installer will also install a "DBFA-updater.exe". 
  Using this, users can search for and have the latest updates auto-installed as released on our Git.

> All file references (paths) have been changed to automatically detect the installation directory.

> NOTE: We have detected a broken 'backup&switch' implementation from DBFA 8.20 - 8.60. We're currently investigating the issue 
        in an attempt to provide a patch soon.
