-----------------------------------------DISCLAIMER-----------------------------------------
* I/delta would NOT be responsible for anything that this update or DBFA (if) would cause.
* Always use ONLY the internal updater built-in to DBFA. DO NOT USE 3rd PARTY DOWNLOADS!!!
* I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, 
* or you getting fired because your alarm app failed. Please do some research 
* if you have any concerns about features included in this update or in DBFA
* before flashing it! YOU are choosing to make these installations, and if
* you blame me in any way for what happens to your device, I will laugh at you.
* BOOM! goes the dynamite
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions:
 - CLOSE DBFA and all its programs. (ofc XDD)
 - Open DBFA's installation directory > 'master' folder (I presume you're already here).
 - Open the 'DBFA' folder and copy everything it contains.
 - Paste this in the 'master' folder. You should get a 'replace' option when you paste for the updated files.
 - That should be it!

NOTE: I recommend taking a backup, either manually or through DBFA Backup & Switch before you proceed.
      As DBFA Backup & Switch is currently in beta, yeah, I'd recommend a full manual backup.


Hope you're having, and will have a good experience with DBFA!
